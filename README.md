TensorFlow.js Data
==================

TensorFlow.js Data provides simple APIs to load and parse data from disk or over
the web in a variety of formats, and to prepare that data for use in machine
learning models (e.g. via operations like filter, map, shuffle, and batch).

This project is the JavaScript analogue of
[tf.data](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/datasets_quickstart) on the
Python/C++ side.  TF.js Data will match the tf.data API to the extent possible.
