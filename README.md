# TensorFlow.js Layers: easy open source machine learning in the browser

TensorFlow.js Layers lets users build, train and execute machine learning models
in the browser, using the established and familiar [Keras](https://keras.io/)
API, without needing to install any software.

TFJS Layers provides higher-level building blocks for neural networks, executing
using the hardware-accelerated
[deeplearn.js](https://github.com/PAIR-code/deeplearnjs) library.
